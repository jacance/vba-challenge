Created VBA script to analyze real stock market data. Script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


	-The ticker symbol.

	-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

	-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

	-The total stock volume of the stock.

	-Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"

	-Conditional formatting highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red.



VBA script is designed to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.



The file alphabetical_testing.xlsx was used to develop code. This data set is smaller and allowed for faster testing. The final code was then run on multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.
